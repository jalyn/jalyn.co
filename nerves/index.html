I’m not sure how short the list is, but the next step in the process is a short chat with someone from the global leadership team.</p><p>I had that 15-minute chat with a managing director from the UK office, and oh boy, pretty sure I flunked it. I was nervous, and this past week had left me a little frazzled (adjusted working hours are annoying and I’d logged 10 hours of work each day). There was rambling, and there was probably incoherency in that rambling.</p><p>He’d asked me for my elevator pitch and I felt myself having an out-of-body experience for a couple of seconds, because I could hear my brain remembering myself literally telling a mentee about elevator pitches. I’d even done mine for her — and therein lies the problem, because the speech I have in my mind was framed for employment, and not for something like this.</p><p>I’m a pretty thoughtful person (or so I like to think), and I do good work. I’m not great at impromptu moments that I can’t prepare for — for example, moments that you don’t anticipate happen during user interviews, but at least I have a semblance of a process or framework to follow.</p><hr><p>Another question that he asked got me still thinking now, though. He’d asked: between all the different initiatives I have on top of the client work, as well as things happening outside of work — this blog included! — how would I begin to manage my time?</p><p>So I answered as truthfully as I could: I have the same 168 hours a week as everyone.</p><p>Yet, I’m more privileged in time than others. I don’t have kids of my own; no other hard commitments to anything else, person or organization.</p><p>The only thing I can control is myself, and that extends to putting guard rails around the hours I want to keep for myself, and everything that I want to do.</p><hr><p>Anyway, he repeated a couple of times that I should be very proud of what I have already achieved to get onto the shortlist. Whatever happens happens, I guess!</p><p>It’s been slightly more than a year since <a href=https://jalyn.co/oh-hello-there-again/ target=_blank rel=noopener>I decided to write one post a week</a>. That’s 52+ posts; some of them thought out, some of them done at the brink of Sunday closing down on me and wanting to get <em>something</em> out.</p><p>Well — it’s Saturday now, and I’m still on an adjusted Sunday – Thursday work week, so it’s the end of the weekend for me. Guess which end of the spectrum this post is going to fall?</p><p>I would do a reflection of how the experience had been for me, but work has been a complete shitshow this past week. My team and I got a huge, shocking announcement, so we are all still processing and making sure that everyone’s feeling okay, or at least feeling like things could look up.</p><p>I know I’m hoping for the latter soon.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:1313/control/><span class=title><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-left" style="user-select:text"><line x1="19" y1="12" x2="5" y2="12" style="user-select:text"/><polyline points="12 19 5 12 12 5" style="user-select:text"/></svg>&nbsp;Previous</span><br><span>In/out of control</span>
