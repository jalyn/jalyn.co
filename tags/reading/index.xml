      <description>Over the course of the last three months, I realized I’ve seriously slipped in my ability to focus deeply.
I’m constantly distracted by everything – messages on Telegram from friends, pings and calls on Teams, social media notifications, emails, refreshing Reddit… the list goes on.
I’d even break my own momentum by sliding the notification screen on my phone down, and noting that I don’t have any.
So, this is a problem.</description>

<p>I’m constantly distracted by everything – messages on Telegram from friends, pings and calls on Teams, social media notifications, emails, refreshing Reddit… the list goes on.</p>
<p>I’d even break my own momentum by sliding the notification screen on my phone down, and noting that I don’t have any.</p>
<p>So, this is a problem.</p>
<p>One quick fix I’ve been using to focus is to force myself to stay on one app, using Guided Access.</p>
<hr>
<p>(Sorry, it&rsquo;s 2024 and I need to update images!)</p>
<h2 id="handy-dandy-instructions">Handy dandy instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; General (you’ll have to scroll to the bottom of the screen)</li>
<li>Click into Guided Access</li>
<li>Turn the toggle on</li>
<li>Go to Passcode Settings on this screen, and use Set Guide Access Passcode – I don’t use the Face ID option so that it gives me an additional barrier</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>Kidding aside – when you go to your reading app of choice, just click on your side button three times to lock usage to that app. It’ll mute notifications, prevent swipe ups/downs, and removes your ability to navigate to other apps as well.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
