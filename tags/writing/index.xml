      <description>I write: on my journal every night, chronicling my frustrations at myself and working through the mess in my head.
I write: in my notebook that I carry with me, scribbles of snippets from podcasts and books and articles.
I write: in Notion, in chat messages, in emails, in documentations that I am sure no one reads but it is still good to keep a second brain for the team at work (or so I tell myself for comfort).</description>

<p>I write: in my notebook that I carry with me, scribbles of snippets from podcasts and books and articles.</p>
<p>I write: in Notion, in chat messages, in emails, in documentations that I am sure no one reads but it is still good to keep a second brain for the team at work (or so I tell myself for comfort).</p>
<p>I write: fiction, tucked away in documents not many people have seen.</p>
<p>And so &ndash; am I a writer?</p>
<hr>
<p>I started <a href="/beginnings"
   
   >
  my blog journey at the very tippy end of 2019
</a>, with some ups and plenty of downs.</p>
<p>It was a slow start, with the pandemic roaring through without warning. Then, I tried to tackle consistency in 2021 and 2022, writing every single week, no matter the topic or the banality.</p>
<p>I succeeded, mostly, but writing fell to the wayside when I started preparing for the GMAT in 2023. Writing started to feel like a chore, and so I stopped doing it.</p>
<p>That is, on hindsight, one of the bigger oops on my personal growth journey.</p>
<p>Even in the age of AI and the threat of elimination with our core stack of skills, I believe writing still remains something that would differentiate the thinkers from the followers.</p>
<p>At the very least, the act of writing helps me to synthesize my own thoughts and understanding of myself, the world, and the society we live in.</p>
<p>(And boy, do we live in a society.)</p>
<hr>
<p>For four and a half years, this site lived on Wordpress, bloated with features as they came. I could never get my theme to work the way I wanted; half-baked widgets installed to try things, and hacks in custom css to make it <em>passable</em>.</p>
<p>So I decided: I wanted to build my own <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history"
   
   
     target="_blank" rel="noopener"
   >
  digital garden
</a>.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should evolve as I do</li>
<li>I get to learn in public</li>
<li>Ideas get to pollinate and cross-cultivate (maybe I am taking the garden analogy to far)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the tech stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has to be lightweight</li>
<li>Updating needs to be easy</li>
</ul>
<p>Above all, I want to have fun writing in public again.</p>
<hr>
<p>All of that to say: this site is now powered by Hugo, I had a steeper-than-expected learning curve with git, and my html/css skills are rusty but not completely down.</p>
<p>It also means that I am manually migrating entries over, but this gives me the chance to prune my thinking, and reflect on my past writing.</p>
<p>So &ndash; please expect breakages in links, and things not working (yet! consider this an MVP) as I figure this out. I&rsquo;m excited to be excited about writing again.</p>
