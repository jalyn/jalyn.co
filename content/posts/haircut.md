| Less good                                                      | Good                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| “You’re so pretty, why did you cut it this short?”             | Less shampooing and less time for the hair to dry |
| “Girls don’t have hair this short”,                            | Less worrying about whether my hair looks unkempt |
| “Next time don’t cut it like this, okay?”                      | Just generally ‘less’, including…                 |
| Haricuts are going to cost more than the $0 I've been spending | Less dypshoria, more euphoria                     |
