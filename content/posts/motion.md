It’s easy to get caught up with *doing things*. 

The dopamine hits make us feel accomplished, as if we have achieved our goal. 

But what is our goal? Are we getting distracted from our true purpose?

There is a danger of mistaking action for motion.

Consider: 

We don’t read to get faster at scanning words — we read to understand ideas and synthesize insights.

We don’t meditate to get better at meditating — we meditate for a clearer mind.

We don’t study to pass tests — we study to grasp human nature, and draw parallels in our present and to shape our future.

We don’t travel to get stamps in our passports — we travel to broaden our perspectives and connecting with others.

Let’s strive for purposeful motion over rote action. 

Let’s measure the immeasurable: growth, impact, and connection. 

It’s not about the quantity or speed of our actions, but the quality of the outcomes and the journey of growth along the way.
