My mentor asked me a simple question when I was catching up with her: What’s in your control, and what’s not?

—

I’ve touched on this topic before, while talking about [stoicism and what we can control](https://jalyn.co/stoicism-and-what-we-can-control/). That was February of this year, which seems both like a short time and a lifetime ago. I had a pretty pithy line to summarize then:

> Things happen, and the only thing we can control is how we respond to them.
> 

Well, turns out, in life, things do happen.

With work, what is it that I can control? What is it that I struggle with accepting that I can’t control?

### I can’t control:

- The (types of) clients the team engages with
- Other people’s actions, reactions, and decisions
- Whether people would participate in one thing, and not another
- How others perceive me

### What I can:

- How I react to these things happening
- How I respond — a slight nuanced difference from the first thing, which is more in the moment
- How much action I take, or do not take
- The mindfulness I take towards my actions

I vaguely alluded to [a big shocking announcement at work last week](/content/posts/nerves.md); cue me googling ‘what to do when manager is laid off’ — [the same manager that was understanding of my morals at work](/content/posts/work-ethics.md) — and still trying to process it, about a week and a half after.

I’m still trying to figure out what it means for me (my own job security, my next step forward, building my promotion case) but it’s definitely given me a lot to think about, when I’m not being busy with actual work and calls, and dealing with bad timing (on my part) to try and get a CSR initiative off the ground.

I’m still on that adjusted working week — from Sunday to Thursday — for at least two more weeks, and I don’t think I’m ever going to get used to that, as long as the rest of my team is on Monday to Friday.
