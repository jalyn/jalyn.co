I got on the shortlist [for the thing](https://jalyn.co/interlude-part-i-lost-count/) that I was fretting about a few weeks ago. I’m not sure how short the list is, but the next step in the process is a short chat with someone from the global leadership team.

I had that 15-minute chat with a managing director from the UK office, and oh boy, pretty sure I flunked it. I was nervous, and this past week had left me a little frazzled (adjusted working hours are annoying and I’d logged 10 hours of work each day). There was rambling, and there was probably incoherency in that rambling.

He’d asked me for my elevator pitch and I felt myself having an out-of-body experience for a couple of seconds, because I could hear my brain remembering myself literally telling a mentee about elevator pitches. I’d even done mine for her — and therein lies the problem, because the speech I have in my mind was framed for employment, and not for something like this.

I’m a pretty thoughtful person (or so I like to think), and I do good work. I’m not great at impromptu moments that I can’t prepare for — for example, moments that you don’t anticipate happen during user interviews, but at least I have a semblance of a process or framework to follow.

Another question that he asked got me still thinking now, though. He’d asked: between all the different initiatives I have on top of the client work, as well as things happening outside of work — this blog included! — how would I begin to manage my time?

So I answered as truthfully as I could: I have the same 168 hours a week as everyone. 

Yet, I’m more privileged in time than others. I don’t have kids of my own; no other hard commitments to anything else, person or organization. 

The only thing I can control is myself, and that extends to putting guard rails around the hours I want to keep for myself, and everything that I want to do.

Anyway, he repeated a couple of times that I should be very proud of what I have already achieved to get onto the shortlist. Whatever happens happens, I guess!

It’s been slightly more than a year since [I decided to write one post a week](https://jalyn.co/oh-hello-there-again/). That’s 52+ posts; some of them thought out, some of them done at the brink of Sunday closing down on me and wanting to get *something* out.

Well — it’s Saturday now, and I’m still on an adjusted Sunday – Thursday work week, so it’s the end of the weekend for me. Guess which end of the spectrum this post is going to fall?

I would do a reflection of how the experience had been for me, but work has been a complete shitshow this past week. My team and I got a huge, shocking announcement, so we are all still processing and making sure that everyone’s feeling okay, or at least feeling like things could look up.

I know I’m hoping for the latter soon.
