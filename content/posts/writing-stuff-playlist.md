This is a music post, because I’m still [taking life slow](https://jalyn.co/slowing-down/). I call this my ‘writing stuff’ playlist, in which I do everything but.

1. Run – Daughter
2. Tip of my Tongue – The Civil Wars
3. Set the Fire to the Third Bar – Snow Patrol ft. Martha Wainwright
4. When I Go – Slow Club
5. Blood Bank – Bon Iver
6. Off I Go – Greg Laswell
7. Alaska – Maggie Rogers
8. Thunder Clatter – Wild Cub
9. Challengers – The New Pornographers
10. My Backwards Walk – Frightened Rabbit

There’s another version of this playlist that’s basically just all of [Little Mix’s discography](/content/posts/little-mix.md), Broadway recordings, and The Barden Bellas, so there’s that.
