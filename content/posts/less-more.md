I came across [this post](https://minimalism.life/journal/constructing-a-simplicity-framework) on Minimalism Life that talks about a simplicity framework.

Now, you know me, and you know I love frameworks, whether I’m testing them or creating them or debunking them.

So let’s see if I can come up with my own list that reflects where I am right now (not the best mentally or physically, unfortunately).

| Need Less                   | Need More                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Anxiety                     | Consistency                   |
| Negativity                  | Patience                      |
| Self-criticism              | Gratitude                     |
| Blame                       | Clarity                       |
| Comparing with others | Making space for others |
| Guilt                       | Writing                       |
| Sluggishness                | Movement                      |
