If you looked up the definition of *sheepish*, you’ll probably find my face right there. Mostly due to the fact that I have been neglecting this journaling habit, which was something I held quite proudly of for last year.

> 2021: never missing a week!
> 
> 2022: does ‘a week’ mean anything, actually? what is this archaic concept of time we hold ourselves to? why have we shackled ourselves—-

Etc, etc.

***

This entire second half of the year has been a test that I have been consistently failing, I think. 

I find myself buried with work, and burying myself with more of it. 

My free thoughts are fleeting, consumed by *the things for work I’m wasting time not doing right now* and *the things I should be doing, but I don’t have the mind space to sit down for them right now*. It’s pretty dire, and in no way strategic.

Or any good for my mental health, that I know for sure.

***

I talk about putting guard rails a lot, but I also kick them down on my own volition. There are things I know:

Better at saying no.

Better at managing my expectations.

Better at putting myself first.

Better, for my own body and mind.
