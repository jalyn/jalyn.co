I listen to a lot of podcasts.

Actually, to be completely accurate, I’m listening to less now compared to pre-pandemic times. There are less pockets of time where I’m doing something menial and can take on the listening at the same time, like commuting, or walking back home from the train station/bus stop.

But I still listen to quite a number of podcasts on the days when I have the time to actually make a concerted effort to take a walk. I tried doing it while I’m working (something that I used to do as well), but these days my focus and attention are completely and utterly shot, so I find that I can’t do that anymore.

Anyway, yes. Podcasts. I’ve been a long-time user of Overcast. There are plenty of features that I love about it — the smart speed (hello, 2.5x that adjusts for silences!), playlist management, and I don’t really *think* when I’m using it, which really is testament to how well designed it is.

The bad things about it? One of the podcast networks that I just started listening to has moved to Spotify exclusively, and *ughhhh*. It’s a smart move from Spotify, because I’m one user out of who knows how many who stopped paying for Spotify Premium when I stopped listening to music, because I was listening more to podcasts.

Still, this means that I now have two apps for the same purpose. I don’t really want to give up on using Overcast, given how much I enjoy using it, but I’m not going to be able to get any of Parcast’s productions on there. I guess I’ll start using Spotify for my other podcasts too, and see if there’s going to be a huge experience difference.

Well played, Spotify. And thank you to Overcast for keeping me company on so many train rides, and saving me an apparent extra 133 hours beyond speed adjustments.
