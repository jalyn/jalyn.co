## Life stuff
- I've been learning driving since July, which has been a huge learning curve but I'm finally enjoying it, I think
    - I don't know how long it'll take me to get an actual license - it's a nightmare trying to get lessons and slots here at the driving center
- I've gone two ends: one with the migration to Hugo for a static site, in lieu of something with a database; and then with Framer over at my [corporate portfolio](https://www.jalyncai.com)
    - Learning git and Go (well, adapted a theme, at least) during the long National Day weekend has been really fun and tickled my brain in a great way
    - I should have a roadmap page on what I want to build in this digital garden, actually
- Also (finally) got a new Macbook Air; the 13-in one with the full specs as I anticipate this to be my main driver for at least the next five years. Fingers crossed.


## Work stuff
- I'm on a time-shifted schedule, working with teammates and clients in the EU/MENA region
    - It's so fun getting my sleep routine and other things disrupted
        - (It's really not)
- I'm thinking *a lot* about what having a corporate job means to me, at this point
    - Might explore fractional leadership roles
    - Might start a one-person business
    - Might just do anything but a corporate job, I think.

## Other stuff
- Currently on track to blow past my [30 book reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11634-2024-reading-challenge)!
- Thinking if I should have a subdomain to build out my reading/media reviews...
