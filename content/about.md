Hey! Iâ€™m Jalyn. I ask why and why not, a lot. 

Iâ€™ve been a person-of-the-internet since the late 90s, and at the end of 2019, I decided to finally start penning down and publishing my thoughts online. I have been on-and-off, but I'm committed to being more consistent and building up my writing craft.

*** 
I used to have these, on the previous build of the site, but I'm contemplating shfiting them to a post. I think they still hold *mostly* true, but I'm in the middle of refining these, as of August 2024.

> ### Mission
> *To empower individuals to know that they have the capacity to be and do more, and drive towards a shared goal of bettering processes and lives*

> I know. Thatâ€™s a lot of words, but it essentially boils down to:
> ### Vision
> *Do awesome things, with awesome people.*

## My writing focuses
This website started out as a blog, but I'm giving the digital garden a spin. I try to update once a week, but time sometimes gets the better of me.

- The pursuit of an intentional, meaningful and happier life
- Productivity (and my struggles)
- Minimalism (and my struggles)
- Fitness, both physical and mental (and my struggles)
- Personal finance (andâ€¦ you know, this Iâ€™ve got a little handle on it right now!)
- Experiments I run on myself, on the above topics

## Other things that fascinate me

- Travel, just like every other person out there that I know
- Equality and intersectionality are themes close to my heart
- I enjoy playing music, and learned to play the ukulele during the pandemic. So far Iâ€™ve only postedÂ [one video of me playing a cover](https://web.archive.org/web/20240415025312/https://www.instagram.com/p/CB8dS2UHwDx/), but hopefully Iâ€™ll work up the courage to post more videos!
- Stage productions â€” Iâ€™ve been known to center whole trips to cultural epicenters around shows I can watch
- If time travel is a thing that will get invented, I hope my future self tells me about it

## About the site
I use Hugo to generate content, with GitHub hosting the repo and GitHub Pages pointing to my domain for publishing. 

I've moved from a Wordpress and shared domain hosting setup since 2019 (and since 2004, as far as tech stacks go) and I've been very happy so far on this self-hosted setup, and to not pay that yearly hosting subscription.  

## Get in touch
