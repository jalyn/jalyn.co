Hey! I’m Jalyn. I ask why and why not, a lot. That is a central theme in the things I like to explore.

I’ve been a person-of-the-internet since the late 90s, and at the end of 2019, I decided to finally start penning down and publishing my thoughts online. I have been on-and-off, but I'm committed to being more consistent and building up my writing craft.

I used to have these, on the previous build of the site: 

## Mission

*To empower individuals to know that they have the capacity to be and do more, and drive towards a shared goal of bettering processes and lives*

I know. That’s a lot of words, but it essentially boils down to:
## Vision

*Do awesome things, with awesome people.*

I think they still hold *mostly* true, but I'm in the middle of refining these, as of August 2024.

## My writing focuses

This website started out as a blog, but I'm giving the digital garden a spin. I try to update once a week, but time sometimes gets the better of me.

- The pursuit of an intentional, meaningful and happier life
- Growth and development
- Minimalism (and my struggles)
- Productivity (and my struggles)
- Fitness, both physical and mental (and my struggles)
- Personal finance (and… you know, this I’ve got a little handle on it right now!)
- Experiments I run on myself, on the above topics

## Other things that fascinate me

- Travel, just like every other person out there that I know
- Equality and intersectionality are themes close to my heart
- I enjoy playing music, and learned to play the ukulele during the pandemic. So far I’ve only posted [one video of me playing a cover](https://web.archive.org/web/20240415025312/https://www.instagram.com/p/CB8dS2UHwDx/), but hopefully I’ll work up the courage to post more videos!
- Stage productions — I’ve been known to center whole trips to cultural epicenters around shows I can watch
- If time travel is a thing that will get invented, I hope my future self tells me about it


## Get in touch with me

- **Instagram:** Slide in [@jalynish](https://www.instagram.com/jalynish)!
- **Email:** [Say hello](mailto:jalyncai@gmail.com), if you prefer something where character limits are not a thing
- **In-person:** If you’re in Singapore — hey! I’m an introvert who masks that very well, according to my friends. I love meeting new people and exchanging ideas and discussions, so if you’d like a coffee or another beverage of choice, send me an email and we’ll work something out
