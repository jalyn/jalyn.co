      <description>Non-negotiable habits There are things in life that people do automatically, like motor reflexes with blinking and swallowing, or actions like locking the door and — unfortunately — checking the phone for notifications.
Similar to values that you do not compromise on, your actions stack towards habits that form the cornerstones of your life. These actions set the tone for how you feel and provides the momentum for other positive habits you’re trying to build.</description>

<p>There are things in life that people <em>do</em> automatically, like motor reflexes with blinking and swallowing, or actions like locking the door and — unfortunately — checking the phone for notifications.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/non-negotiables/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >values that you do not compromise on</a>, your actions stack towards habits that form the cornerstones of your life. These actions set the tone for how you feel and provides the momentum for other positive habits you’re trying to build.</p>
<hr>
<p>With a few years of experiments on my belt, here are my non-negotiable habits as of August 2024.</p>
<h3 id="one-liner-gratitude-when-i-wake-up">One-liner gratitude when I wake up</h3>
<p>When the alarm on the phone goes off, I make the ten-step hike from my bed to the table and switch it off.</p>
<p>I start a new entry in my daily log on Notion; take a pause through the haziness of sleep, and write one thing that I am grateful for, in the title of the entry.</p>
<p>Logging it on Notion serves as a time stamp for my wake-up times, which is always useful for trend-spotting each month.</p>
<p>I try to log down my dream(s) in the body of the note. They disappear like wisps, sometimes.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-my-time-nutrition-and-expenses">Tracking: My time, nutrition, and expenses</h3>
<p>Even though we now know that the quote <a href="https://nesslabs.com/what-gets-measured-gets-managed"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >“what gets measured gets managed”</a> is a misnomer at best, and an opposite interpretation at worst, it is still helpful for me.</p>
<p>First, it gives me the outputs for my behaviour.</p>
<p>Want to know how many minutes I’ve invested in traveling this year? I see it in <a href="https://toggl.com/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Toggl</a>, and because I’ve been tracking since 2018, I can work out how many experience dividends I’m getting from year to year.</p>
<p>Want to know how much money I’m spending on groceries up until today for the month? <a href="https://www.spendee.com/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Spendee</a> tells me the amount, because I’ve made it a habit to log every purchase the moment I make them.</p>
<p>And for nutrition? It’s the same logic, and helpful as I keep track of the amount of protein I ingest every day.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, the act of doing the thing makes me want to be more conscientious and deliberate. This has been a huge mind shift in the way I approach these building blocks of life.</p>
<p>(Though there is something to be said about the scarcity mindset I have observed in me sometimes. Something to experiment more on!)</p>
<h3 id="work-outs-at-least-three-times-a-week">Work outs, at least three times a week</h3>
<p>My workout routine has me completing four workouts a week, so three times is keeping it safe on weeks where I feel like my back can’t handle more than, or if I fall sick/injured.</p>
<p>On typical weeks when I’m not traveling, I pick myself up first thing in the morning to do them. It sets my energy levels higher through the day when I do, but there are slight differences in power and endurance when I do them later on in the day.</p>
<p>As an addition, at a minimum I’m aiming for <em>activity</em> every day. It’s a morning walk these days, on days I don’t go to the gym.</p>
<h3 id="meditating-at-least-10-minutes-a-day">Meditating, at least 10 minutes a day</h3>
<p>I don’t have a set time for when I do this; even with a 1,695 day streak, I’m still playing around with what works best.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that I <em>do</em> it, whether it is right before I settle into working, during a break in the middle of the day, or when I am walking.</p>
<h3 id="reading-at-least-ten-minutes-a-day">Reading, at least ten minutes a day</h3>
<p>My Kindle (a pretty laggy 7th-gen Paperwhite) is never far from me — on my desk, on the table, in my bag — and if I have free moments in between calls at work, I’m trying to reach the end of a chapter in a non-fiction book.</p>
<p>Additionally, I block half an hour before bedtime to do light fiction reading, though the time expands and contracts depending on when the work day ends; something to work on more diligently.</p>
<h3 id="journaling-before-i-sleep">Journaling before I sleep</h3>
<p>Through my life I have trialed and tested many different mediums (digital vs. a proper journal), timings (mornings vs. nights), and methods (free writing, lists, bullet, unsent letters…).</p>
<p>For now, I journal on <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Day One</a> through my phone (it’s telling me I have a 1,413 day streak today!), where I have two journals: one for free-form writing about what happened during the day, and another to answer the daily prompt.</p>
<p>The free-form writing journal gives me the chance to unload what is on my mind that has been playing incessantly throughout the day.</p>
<p>I find that reflecting on my actions, and dumping the contents of my brain to work through potential solutions, ways I should be reacting, and paths forward has been helpful in clarity.</p>
<p>For the daily prompts, that’s just a fun way to surface topics I wouldn’t think of, and reach to the edges of diving into them.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m probably forgetting non-negotiables that are second nature to me (i.e. drinking 2 litres of water, using dental floss, applying sunblock), but that is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>More that I am thinking about: Is there an optimal number or a maximum of habits before the system falls apart? What about rigidity vs. fluidity of the way I act upon them? Psychological barriers or breakthroughs?</p>

      <title>The seven sins (and why my top-ranked is gluttony)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/gluttony/</link>

      <description>Out of the seven sins, I feel like my top three rotate between gluttony, sloth and pride.
Some days, I am one with sloth; I am the sloth; sloth becomes me, etc.
Gluttony, on the other hand, strikes me in cycles.
(Note: Possible trigger for disordered eating here!)
I try to put guardrails on my life, with habits like meal prepping, or working out and hitting a specific step count every day.</description>

<p>(Note: Possible trigger for disordered eating here!)</p>
<p>I try to put guardrails on my life, with habits like meal prepping, or working out and hitting a specific step count every day.</p>
<p>This year… has been kind of rough, on all these aspects. I’m not sure what has changed, and if it’s just an accelerated version of burnout in the time of this pandemic, but it is somehow significantly worse than this time last year.</p>
<p>Instead of meal prepping, I either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skip a meal because there’s nothing I really want to eat, or;</li>
<li>Go on my phone and start (to the tune of Waving Through a Window) tap-tap-tapping for food to magically show up at my door steps, anytime from 30 to 50 minutes later</li>
</ul>
<p>In Thomas Aquinas’ <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3148.htm#article4"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Summa Theologica</a>, he outlined the five ways that gluttony is committed. These include food that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>too expensive (I have two extremes with my cravings: 40 cents instant noodles, or a $250 buffet)</li>
<li>too elaborately prepared (Maybe not so much on this one? Score?)</li>
<li>too much in quantity ()</li>
<li>eaten too quickly (I guess? It depends. If I’m eating by myself, I tend to do it quite fast so that I can do other things)</li>
<li>eaten too early (my teammates might dispute this, because I eat lunch at 3pm, reallll healthily like, so… reverse-gluttony?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oooh, boy. Lots to unpack here. I also know that the only way is through, so I just have to identify my obstacles in meal prepping again to do it more consistently now.</p>

      <title>Constantly breaking in my shoes</title>

      <description>I have this pair of shoes that I really like.
It looks nice and it has rainbow stripes on the outer sides of each shoe, which makes me feel like I’m representing my community in a little way that I can.
I bought it in July 2019 — actually the last thing I bought on ASOS, now that I’m checking my order history. Historically, me and shoes don’t have the best of relationships, with my feet being too wide for a lot of them.</description>

<p>I bought it in July 2019 — actually the last thing I bought on ASOS, now that I’m checking my order history. Historically, me and shoes don’t have the best of relationships, with my feet being too wide for a lot of them.</p>
<hr>
<p>(I know, when I say “historically”, it gives the impression that I buy a lot of shoes and… I don’t. Right now I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pair of Timberland boots that have definitely been worn enough for the value I paid for it;</li>
<li>My gym shoes which are Nike Metcons, which I don’t even wear because I do my workouts at home now;</li>
<li>My running/jogging/walking shoes which have grease marks on the sides of the white cupsole because I wore that while go-karting;</li>
<li>This pair of rainbow sneakers)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Anyway. Back to these shoes.</p>
<p>I break them in, then I stop wearing them for a long time.</p>
<p>I’ve broken them in, no less than four times.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I wore them again. Again, they rubbed against the back of my ankles and I needed to place bandages on them mid-chowing down my ice cream.</p>
<p>It made me think about all the other things that I do, like I’m Sisyphus, over and over again futilely. I thought if it was like that apocryphal quote attributed to Einstein about the definition of insanity, and doing things over and over and expecting different results, but decided it wasn’t since I know what the result would be, so Sisyphus it is.</p>
<p>It’s probably one of the least productive aspects of my life; not setting up proper frameworks so that I’m manually doing things for the first time all the time. Or it’s the lack of automation that gets me.</p>
<p>For me, beyond breaking in my shoes, these are some other things that are like that:</p>
<p><strong>My writing progress</strong></p>
<p>In that I don’t really <em>have</em> one. I usually sit down and start typing, which goes against everything about writing that I’ve learned (structure, an objective, etc). So I just sit down, usually every Saturday or Sunday, and stare at my Notion table of all the topics I’ve brainstormed in the past, but haven’t really fleshed out.</p>
<p><strong>Food prep</strong></p>
<p>I try to eat moderately healthy most of the time, but I definitely do better and more consistently if I’m sticking to a routine. Ingredient prepping on Sundays help, but the space in the fridge is (very) limited, so sometimes it feels like I’m wasting a lot of time doing it on an ad-hoc basis every day, and then I just… don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>Investing monthly</strong></p>
<p>This one is a little tricky. As far as I know, there’s no automated way of doing it so I can do it out-of-sight-out-of-mind, so what usually happens is that at the end of the month, I have to</p>
<ol>
<li>transfer money from my bank to my broker account</li>
<li>convert SGD to USD</li>
<li>buying the stock at market rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are things that break down here, like forgetting it in the first place, or looking like the monkey puppet at how high it has climbed despite the world being, well. Gesturing generally at the world’s direction.</p>
<hr>
<p>If I start poking at more parts of my life, I can probably find more things (like lazing in bed for up to an hour at a time and conveniently skipping working out because oops no time left, or falling behind on my reading challenge and having to play catch-up all the time, or in the work context where I consistently have to create new elements for wireframes instead of having set components that I can use all the time).</p>
<p>Instead, I’m just going to relax for the rest of this Sunday because the next few weeks at work is going to be tough before my week-long break.</p>
