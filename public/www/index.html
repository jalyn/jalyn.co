My stop-gap solution was to hand him my wireless charger, which worked for a bit technically, but wasn’t suited for his work flow.
That’s okay; it was nearly Father’s Day so my sister and I got the iPhone SE for him.
After a week or so of waiting (which was about 6 days longer than I had anticipated; something to unpack here about my apparent high standards for delivery timelines), it arrived.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/blundering/>Learning and blundering in chess and life</a></h3><span class=date>April 7, 2024</span><p>Looks like this year is an actual year of learning, because I decided to pick chess up on a whim.
A real whim, or a procrastination technique from doing up my portfolio? You decide.
I knew how to play the basics of Chinese chess (象棋), which just meant I knew how the pieces moved, so there are some parts that now feel familiar. I mean, am I calling the knight a horse (馬), because that’s what the Chinese piece is and they move in the exact same way in the L shape, except there are more restrictions on a Chinese horse?</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/skiing/>On skiing and trying things for the first time</a></h3><span class=date>January 31, 2024</span><p>I’m generally risk-averse, I learned about myself a long time ago. I’m overly cautious, frenetically anxious, and incessantly worry about the unknowns. (Which, yes, is an issue in itself, and something I’m trying to manage, to varying degrees of success.)
Yet, in the last week, I found myself strapping into boots and skis that made my body cry in agony. I fell no less than half a dozen times on the first day.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/2022-year-in-review/>2022: Year in Review</a></h3><span class=date>January 1, 2023</span><p>It’s become a habit now; a yearly one, to look back on the year that has passed and reflect on what has gone well and what could’ve gone better (see: 2021, 2020). My writing is rusty now, with my non-rigour and letting my habit die off this year.
2022 has been a mixed bag of blessings and regrets, and of going on auto-pilot and letting things fall on the wayside.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/little-mix/>a little (Little Mix) mix</a></h3><span class=date>May 16, 2022</span><p>I went through the entire year between 2016 – 2017 just solely listening to Little Mix, and not much of anything else. Before that, I was an iNdIe™ person (think Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens, Blind Pilot, Frightened Rabbit, etc) and a show tunes (jazz hands) kind of person.
So, not so much Top 40.
I wish I could remember how I got into listening to Little Mix, but it was definitely right around when Shout Out To My Ex came out (along with the Glory Days album).</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/how-to-fun/>How to Fun</a></h3><span class=date>April 24, 2022</span><p>I’m turning 33 in 3 days, and for a couple of days, I was contemplating if I wanted to do that thing where I try to come up with 33 life lessons and pithy quotables. Maybe I’ll still do it next week, but this week I wanted to talk about something I’ve been trying to do these days.
I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts on the Pushkin network, like Cautionary Tales, Bad Women; right now I want to think a little more about a specific episode on The Happiness Lab: How to have fun.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/iamremarkable/>#IAmRemarkable</a></h3><span class=date>March 22, 2022</span><p>Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending an #IAmRemarkable session hosted by Akua Nyame-Mensah. The hour and a half flew past like it was nothing, and filled me with the hope that one day, too, I will not be filled with dread when it comes to talking about my own achievements.
(Even typing that! “My own achievements”…)
Why I attended this More than just for personal growth though, I definitely want the ladies and other marginalized members of my team to be able to have the confidence and competence to talk about what they have done and achieved.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/2021-year-in-review/>2021: Year in Review</a></h3><span class=date>January 1, 2022</span><p>I like having a chill and quiet last day of the year, and I was ready to spend the whole of this last day of the year writing this. Instead, my laptop wouldn’t start up when I woke up yesterday morning — seemed emblematic of 2021’s vibes — and I spent half the day going to a couple of repair shops, receiving the bad news about a corroded motherboard, balking at the price for repair, trying to make the call on whether I should just buy a new MacBook Air/Pro and let this 2017 laptop’s value after amortization be higher than I anticipated…</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/speech/>Articulate speaking</a></h3><span class=date>September 5, 2021</span><p>During a first session with a mentee (my ADPList profile, if you want to book a session!) I discovered my latest speech habit: prefacing what I say with “obviously”, with examples like:
“Obviously, this varies from place to place…” “Obviously, this is a sweeping statement; I don’t mean everything…” “Obviously, when we’re doing this, we won’t do it exactly like I’m saying now…” I’m trying to figure out why or when I’ve started doing this.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/gluttony/>The seven sins (and why my top-ranked is gluttony)</a></h3><span class=date>August 22, 2021</span><p>Out of the seven sins, I feel like my top three rotate between gluttony, sloth and pride.
Some days, I am one with sloth; I am the sloth; sloth becomes me, etc.
Gluttony, on the other hand, strikes me in cycles.
(Note: Possible trigger for disordered eating here!)
I try to put guardrails on my life, with habits like meal prepping, or working out and hitting a specific step count every day.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/antiracism-singapore/>Racism in Singapore / Anti-racism</a></h3><span class=date>June 12, 2021</span><p>I’m a Chinese Singaporean, which means that while I’m in Singapore, I have not encountered racism, and will never experience it.
In the past couple of weeks, some racists have been caught on video:
Tan Boon Lee, a lecturer at the school I went to, confronted an interracial couple with some harmful stereotypes, as well as being an Islamophobe A Chinese woman banged on a gong to cause distress during her Hindu neighbor’s prayer ritual Yet another Chinese influencer used the trauma of the hurtful recording to create content for the sole purpose of entertainment So so so many accounts being documented on the #CALLITOUTSG tag The thing is, we know these aren’t isolated incidents.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/shoes/>Constantly breaking in my shoes</a></h3><span class=date>April 11, 2021</span><p>I have this pair of shoes that I really like.
It looks nice and it has rainbow stripes on the outer sides of each shoe, which makes me feel like I’m representing my community in a little way that I can.
I bought it in July 2019 — actually the last thing I bought on ASOS, now that I’m checking my order history. Historically, me and shoes don’t have the best of relationships, with my feet being too wide for a lot of them.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/2020-year-in-review/>2020: Year in Review</a></h3><span class=date>December 31, 2020</span><p>Oh, 2020. A year that started out promisingly, and subsequently veered off-course about fifty million times over.
I’m one of the lucky ones – holding the privilege to hold my job and not worry about money, not having to experience the tremendous loss and the grief the pandemic brought, and living in a country where the response hasn’t been just a real life depiction of my favorite gif.
So, I’m happy to see 2020 behind us.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/fitbit-charge-4/>One+ month with the FitBit Charge 4</a></h3><span class=date>December 23, 2020</span><p>Two months ago, I talked about my terrible sleep habits, and how using an app on the phone to track my sleep wasn’t the best solution for me at the time.
Since then, I’ve gotten my FitBit Charge 4, and have been using it for a little over a month. I got the Storm Blue Classic Band — to be more accurate, my friend Siew who placed the order for me got me that variant (I told her to surprise me) — but any of the other choices would have fit my dark and neutral wardrobe anyway.</p></div><div class=mention-item><h3><a href=/hoarding/>On digital clutter and hoarding</a></h3><span class=date>January 11, 2020</span><p>I once told a friend that I would love to just own 50 items. Because, of course, my self-worth is tied up in the number of things I possess. I kid, but it’s true that I don’t have a lot of things.
What I do have, though, is digital clutter.
Oh, so many photos and videos and documents accumulated over the last 13 years as a Mac user. These are files that are dutifully backed up both over the cloud (Dropbox, for now) and on a hard drive (although it tells me it has been 183 days since I’ve last hooked that up ); these are configurations that have been Migration Assisted through the machines that have gone through the years with me.</p></div></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:1313/gluttony/><span class=title><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-left" style="user-select:text"><line x1="19" y1="12" x2="5" y2="12" style="user-select:text"/><polyline points="12 19 5 12 12 5" style="user-select:text"/></svg>&nbsp;Previous</span><br><span>The seven sins (and why my top-ranked is gluttony)</span>
